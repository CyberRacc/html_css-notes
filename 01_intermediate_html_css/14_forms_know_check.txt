    Explain what the form element is for and what two attributes it should always include.

        The form element is a container for forms, like a div.

        It takes two attributes, action and method.

        Action is used to tell the form which URL to send the data to be processed.

        Method is used to tell the brwoser which HTTP request method it should use
        to submit the form. GET and POST methods are the two that are most used.

    Explain what form controls are at a high level.

        Form controls are simply a way to collect data from a user, most common one is <input>

    What is the name attribute for?

        It serves as a reference to the data inputted into a form control after submitting it.

        It is for the backend, not the user.

    What are the three most common form controls you can use for allowing users to
    select predefined options?

        <select> <option> </select>

        The select dropdown.

        Radio buttons:

            <div>
                <input type="radio" id="adult" name="ticket_type" value="adult">
                <label for="adult">Adult</label>
            </div>

        Checkboxes:

            <div>
                <input type="checkbox" id="onions" name="topping" value="onions">
                <label for="onions">Onions</label>
            </div>

    What are the three types of buttons in HTML?

        <button type="button"></button> // Generic
        <button type="submit"></button> // Submit form
        <button type="reset"></button>  // Resets/clears form to default values. 

    What are the two most challenging aspects of styling forms?

        1. Browsers have default styles, and each browser has different ones.

        So you need to override all of these default styles in all browsers to style
        your forms consistently.

        2. Some elements are difficult or impossible to style.

        Checkboxes and radio buttons are difficult to style.

        Calendar and date pickers are impossible to style and you should use a JavaScript
        library if you need this.
