    What is the difference between static and relative positioning?

        Relative acts the same as static positioning except it allows
        you to change the top, left, bottom and right positions, this
        change is relative from the original position of the element.

    What is absolute positioning useful for?

        When you want to position something at an exact point on the screen without
        disturbing other elements around it.

        Using absolute positioning removes an element from the normal document
        flow.

        Using this allows you to place an element anywhere on the screen using top, right
        , bottom and left properties.

    What is the difference between fixed and sticky positioning?

        Sticky positioning acts as a fixed element until scrolled past, then it sticks to the
        screen and follows the user as they scroll down.
