### Broser Compatibility ###

    It's important to keep the variety of browsers in mind that users may be using.

    It's also important to make sure you consider the mobile versions of different
    browsers.


    You need to make sure that you're testing your web applications against the browsers
    which are most likely to be used by the users. Chrome, Safari, Firefox and other
    chromium-based browsers like Mircosoft-Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, etc.

    It's worth testing with Internet Explorer too if you need someone that uses it to
    access the website.

    Applications may behave differently in different browsers.

    W3C World Wide Web Consortium is the authority behind developing web standards
    to maximize accessibility and consistency of the web experience. W3C is also the
    authority to develop new features in the CSS. This is a closely collaborative
    approach with the Web as a community as well as the companies developing the web browsers.


## When is it safe to use new features? ##

    As exciting as it is to implement new features, there is a risk of rushing.
    It would not be a positive experience for your users to find that, for example,
    your application used to work well in Firefox, but due to the changes in the codebase
    it is now unusable in Firefox but works well in Safari. Thankfully, there is a
    tool that can help you prevent this situation.

## Mobile Browsers ##

    On iPadOS and iOS, Safari is technically the only supported browser. You can install
    Firefox or Chrome, but they are not full browsers as they are still using the Safari
    rendering engine (WebKit).

    You may need to adjust your applications to make them work correctly on mobile.

    Browsers provide a way to emulator other devices, so you can test what the website
    will look like and how it will behave on a mobile screen, but remember that
    all you're emulating is the screen size. Any specific considerations of the
    OS will not be reproduceable, which means it may still behave differently on the
    actual device.
