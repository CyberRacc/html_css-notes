Browsers by default inject some style.

h1 elements are bigger and bolder than regular text

links are blue and underlined.

list (ul and ol) both have a bunch of padding around them.

All browsers have a default built-in stylesheet

Using a CSS Reset, which is a file that undoes browser defaults makes elements
behave the same in all browsers.

You don't have to use one though, but it's an option.

The most popular CSS resets are:

    The Meyer Reset

    Normalize.css

This is a really good website for checking element default styles:
