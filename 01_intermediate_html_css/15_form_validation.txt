### Form Validation ###

    Validations allow us to set specific constraints or rules that determine what data users can
    enter into an input. When a user enters data that breaks the rules, a message will appear,
    providing feedback on what was wrong with the entered data and how to fix it.

    Validations are vital for well-designed forms.

    They protect the backend from recieve incorrect data, and make it simpler for users.

## Required validation ##

    To make a field required, just add the required attribute to it:

        <form action="#" method="get">
        <div>
            <label for="user_email">*Email:</label>
            <input type="email" id="user_email" name="user_email" required>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>
            <label for="user_password">*Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="user_password" name="user_password" required>
        </div>

        <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form>

    We should always indicate which fields are required. This is often done by adding
    an asterisk to the required field label like we have done in the above example.

## Text length validations ##

    Sometimes we need users to enter a minimum or maximum amount of text into a field.
    Real-world examples of using these validations would be the old 140 character limit that
    Twitter had.

    # Minimum length validation #

        Use the minlength attribute with an integer value:

            <form action="#" method="get">
                <div>
                    <textarea placeholder="What's happening?" minlength="3"></textarea>
                </div>
                
                <button type="submit">Tweet</button>
            </form>

    # Maximum length validation #

        Use the maxlength attribute with an integer value:

            <form action="#" method="get">
                <div>
                    <textarea placeholder="What's happening?" maxlength="20"></textarea>
                </div>

                <button type="submit">Tweet</button>
            </form>

    # Combining validations #

        We can use both of the above together to have a min and max length.

## Number range validations ##

    You might need to control the range of values that users can enter into number based
    form controls.

    Use the min and max attributes.

    These attributes will only work on number-based form controls such as the number,
    dates and time inputs.

    Some real-world use cases for using these validations would be limiting the quantity on
    a product order form or choosing the number of passengers on a flight booking
    form.

    # Min validation #
