    Explain the difference between a track and a line.

        A track is the space between the lines, one horizontal track and one vertical track.

        A line is what separates and defines the tracks.

    What is the smallest unit on a grid?

        A grid cell.

    What kind of value do we give to the grid-column-start or grid-column-end properties?

        We give an integer of which line we want the grid-column to end and start at.
        First line is 1 and counts up from there.

    Which property can we use to combine all the start and end values for a grid item?

        #living-room {
            grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;
        }

    Which grid container property can map out a visual structure of grid items?

        grid-template-areas

        Example:

                    .container {
            display: inline-grid;
            grid-template: 40px 40px 40px 40px 40px / 40px 40px 40px 40px 40px;
            background-color: lightblue; 
            grid-template-areas:
                "living-room living-room living-room living-room living-room"
                "living-room living-room living-room living-room living-room"
                "bedroom bedroom bathroom kitchen kitchen"
                "bedroom bedroom bathroom kitchen kitchen"
                "closet closet bathroom kitchen kitchen"    
        }

        .room {
            border: 1px solid;
            font-size: 50%;
            text-align: center;
        }

        #living-room {
            grid-area:  living-room;
        }

        #kitchen {
            grid-area: kitchen;
        }

        #bedroom {
            grid-area: bedroom;
        }

        #bathroom {
            grid-area: bathroom;
        }

        #closet {
            grid-area: closet;
        }
