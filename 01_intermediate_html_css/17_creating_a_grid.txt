### Creating a Grid ###

## Setting up a grid ##

    # Grid container #

        Think of a CSS Grid as a container with items.
        When you make an element a grid container, it will "contain" the whole grid.

        An element is turned into a grid container with display: grid;
        or display: inline-grid;

        .container {
            display: grid;
        }

        The parent element marked class="container" becomes a grid container and each of the
        direct child elements become grid items automatically.

        With CSS Grid, you don't have to assign each child element a property.

        Only DIRECT child elements will become grid items here. If we had another
        element as a child element under one of these child elements, it would not be a grid item.

            <div class="container">
                <div>Item 1</div>
                <div>Item 2
                    <p>I am not a grid item!</p>
                </div>
                <div>Item 3</div>
                <div>Item 4</div>
            </div>

        Grid items can also be grid containers. So you could make grids inside grids.
