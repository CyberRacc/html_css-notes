### Flexbox and Grid ###

    One way to decide between flex and grid is if your design starts from the content, or fromthe layout.

    In Content First Design, you begin with how the content should be, and the layout follows.

    This is a great oppurtunity to use Flexbox. Its flexible nature gives you control of the
    behaviour of items through logical rules. How they gro, shrink, their ideal size and position
    in relation to eachother, all make the layout dynamic. Whilst Flexbox gives you control over
    its content, the final layout is only a consequence.

    In Layour First Design, you decide how you want the pieces arranges, then fill in the content.
    That is when Grid shines. Defining grid row and column tracks gives you full control of layout.
    Content in a grid can only fill the spaces of explicit or implicit tracks. So, when you have an
    idea of how the big picture of a container should look like, grid is the clear choice.

    Ultimately it comes down to personal preference and what a developer feels is easier
    for whatever the given task may be.
