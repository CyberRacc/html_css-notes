### Frameworks and Preprocessors ###

    Preprocessors are also known as precompilers.

    Many job requirements include Bootstrap and SASS so it's helpful to know what these
    are and where to look for them if you need to learn them.

## Frameworks overview ##

    Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind do a lot of the heavy lifting of packaging up
    commonly used CSS code for you, even icons and interactions (like menu dropdowns).

    They are designed to abstract away the process of coding intuitive, reusable and
    responsive elements.

    A CSS framework is ultimately just a bundle of CSS that you can use and access, using
    the classes defined by the framework.

    For example, many frameworks provide a class called .btn that will add all the needed
    styles to your buttons, without you having to write any CSS.

    In general, to use a framework, you need to understand how it expects you to
    structure your website and which classes it uses to apply its specific set of styles.

    There are quite a few frameworks available to choose from. Two other frameworks to know
    about are Bulma and Foundation. But there are many more.

## Disadvantages of frameworks ##

    Frameworks can help you get up and running quickly, but they can constrain you in the long
    run. And once you've started a project using a framework, it can be difficult to
    remove it. So whether or not you use framworks for projects in the future is up to you,
    and perhaps your employer.

## Preprocessors overview ##

    Also known as precompilers, preprocessors are languages that help you write CSS more easily.
    They reduce code repetition and provide all sorts of time-saving and code-saving
    features.

    A few examples: preprocessors allow you to write loops, join multiple stylesheets, and
    nest classes.

    CSS Preprocessors are extensions to vanilla CSS that provide some extra functionality
    such as nesting, mixins, and variables. When you run the processor, it takes your code
    and turns it into vanilla CSS that you can import into your project.

    Preprocessors have some unique and helpful tools, but many of their most helpful
    features have been implemented in vanilla CSS, so it might not be worth the overhead
    of learning one unless you think you really need these features.

    Some of the standard preprocessors in use are SASS, LESS and Stylus.
