    What are the four CSS math functions we covered above?

        calc()
        min()
        max()
        clamp()

    How do we use CSS math functions in our CSS?

        We use them for creating colour in gradients, rgb, hsl etc. And to create
        more complex responsive websites with min() max() and clamp().

    How can CSS functions help make websites and applications more responsive?

        By resizing elements based on the space available, the font-size and zoom level
        that the user has set. This can help create much more appealing and
        responsive websites that still look nice even when the font-size or zoom level
        has changed.

        For example, clamp() can be used to set a minimum, maximum and ideal font-size
        so as it changes, it cannot resize to extremes.
