### Introduction to Grid ###

    ## A look back at flex ##

        Whilst Flexbox allows you to build a layout of rows an columns together, it isn't
        always easy.

        Setting up a two dimensional layout of cards is much easier in CSS Grid:

            .grid-container {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-columns: 75px 75px 75px;
                grid-template-rows: 75px 75px;
                gap: 32px;
            }

            .card {
                background-color: peachpuff;
                border: 1px solid black;
            }

    You should use flex and grid together, not one or the other,
    Flex for some things, grid for others.
