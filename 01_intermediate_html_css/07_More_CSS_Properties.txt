You only have to memorise enough CSS properties, not all of them, it's a much smaller list than what's actually
available.

## Background ##

    The background property is shorthand for 8 different background-related properties.

    You can change the background colour.

    You can specify background images.

    Change the position and size of background images.

    Change how background images repeat or tile if they are too small to fill their container.

    You can also have multiple background layers.

    You can use these properties individually which is actually clearer than the shorthand and is recommended.

    You do not need to memorise the syntax and order of each property, it's enough to know they exist and
    have a general idea of what they do.

## Borders ##

    border: 4px solid black; # Shorthand
    border-radius for rounded corners

    Border radius stuff:

        border-radius: 30px;

        border-radius: 25% 10%;

        border-radius: 10% 30% 50% 70%;

        border-radius: 10% / 50%;

        border-radius: 10px 100px / 120px;

        border-radius: 50% 20% / 10% 40%;

        This applies to the whole background, even if the element has no border.

        the clipping can be defined by the background-clip property.

        These properties are shorthand of:

            border-top-left-radius
            border-top-right-radius
            border-bottom-right-radius
            border-bottom-left-radius

## box-shadow ##

    box-shadow adds a shadow effect around an element.

    This is useful to create a sense of depth on your page.

    Also to add some subtle separation between elements.

    It's best used sparingly and subtly, prefer lighter barely visible shadows to darker or
    brighter colours.

## Overflow ##

    Using overflow, you can define what happens to an element when its content is too big to fit.

    The most common usage is to add scrollbars to an element.

    For example, a card style element with scrollable content.

## Opacity ##

    Easy but very useful in some circumstances.

    Use to make things transparent.
