## Introduction ##

    Emmet is a plugin, built into VS Code that helps you write HTML and CSS
    more efficiently by providing a bunch of clever shortcuts.

## Learning Outcomes ##

    By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

    Use some of Emmetâ€™s most useful shortcuts.
    Set up custom Emmet keybindings in VS Code.

## Emmet ##

    Emmet is a really useful tool for anyone that works a lot with HTML and CSS.
    Luckily, Emmet does not have that big of a learning curve, and if you already
    know how to write HTML and CSS you'll have no trouble picking up Emmet
    abbreviations.

    In VS Code, entering ! should trigger Emmet suggestion.

    Pressing enter creates a basic HTML boilerplate to save a bunch of time.

    There are lots of useful Emmet abbreviations that you should check out,
    like Wrap with Abbreviation and Remove Tag.

    Check the keyboard shortcuts by clicking the cog at the bottom left, then
    "keyboard shortcuts" or by pressing "crtl + k" then "ctrl + s".

    After entering the keyboard shortcuts window, you should be able to access
    all of the Emmet actions by searching for Emmet:<action>. In our case,
    it will be Emmet:Wrap With Abbreviation

    You can now add a shortcut to it by clicking the plug sign and entering
    whichever key combination you would like for that specific action.
    You can do the same for Remove Tag by searching for Emmet:Remove tag.
