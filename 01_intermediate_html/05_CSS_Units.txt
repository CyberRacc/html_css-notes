There are many diffrent units used to define sizes in CSS.

The difference between Absolute units and Relative units.

## Absolute Units ##

    Absolute units are those that are always the same in any context.

    px (pixels) is an absolute unit because the size of any pizel does't change
    relative to anything else on the page.

    px is the ONLY absolute unit you should be using for web projects.

    The rest are for printing because they are related to physical units
    like in (inch) and cm (centimetre)

## Relative Units ##

    Relative units can change based on their context.

# em and rem #

    em and rem both refer to a font size but they are often use to define
    other sizes in CSS.

    A general rule of thumb is to prefer rem.

    1em is the font-size of an element (or the lement's parent if you are using it
    to set font size)

    For example, if an element's font-size is 16px, then setting its width to 4em
    would make its width 64px (16 * 4 == 64).

    1rem is the font size of the root element (either:root or html). The math
    works the same with rem as with em but without the added complexity of
    keeping track of the parent's font size. Relying on em could mean that
    a particular size could change if the context changes, which is likely not
    what you want.

# Viewport units #

    The units vh and vw relate to the size of the viewport.

    Specifically, 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height and 1vw is equal to 
    1% of the viewport width.

    This is great for things like full-screen app-like interfaces.

## Conclusion ##

Really when it comes to absolute units, just use rem for font-size and px for everything else.
Em is more confusing than it's worth and can lead to confusing size-related bugs.

Using a relative size like rem to define font sizes accross your site is recommended.
Users  will want to change the font size to increase readability, and most browsers
allow this.
